Gesamtkunstwerk can be defined as “the total artwork” meaning different mediums of art combining to create a whole which in turn elicited emotions from its viewer.
  I think one example that comes to mind is architectural buildings. 
  Looking towards design as a contemporary tool we can see various aspects of a building are artistically chosen to form the whole.
  For example, looking towards a modern building distinct color, placement of furniture, types of furniture, interior of the house, exterior design, and overall scaling and shape of the building all complement each other and elicit emotions from the viewer and occupier.
