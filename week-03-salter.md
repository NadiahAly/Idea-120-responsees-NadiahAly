# Gesamtkunstwerk Contemporary Tools
Gesamtkunstwerk can be defined as “the total artwork” meaning different mediums of art combining to create a whole which in turn elicited emotions from its viewer.I think one example that comes to mind is architectural buildings. Looking towards design as a contemporary tool we can see various aspects of a building are artistically chosen to form the whole. For example, looking towards a modern building distinct color, placement of furniture, types of furniture, interior of the house, exterior design, and overall scaling and shape of the building all complement each other and elicit emotions from the viewer and occupier. These different tools all come together to create a whole building in turn creating art that is considered Gesamtkunstwerk.  
  Gesamtkunstwerk was not limited to the physical world but there are many examples present in the digital world as well. Looking towards the Rhizome Anthology as an example we can see the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk occur in “Natural Processes” by Exonemo in 2003-2004.  “Natural Processes” is an installation that takes the Google search engine as it was in 2003 and transforms it into a large-scale painting and then back to a digital media via webcam. This type of art contains oils and acrylic painting, the web, the physical interaction of the individual clicks, and aspects of the UX. This creates a sensory overload for it google homepage was something that one sees everywhere so changing it up through this process allowed various modes of representations to be presented. Through the diverse types of mediums used here; the art is considered Gesamtkunstwerk.
