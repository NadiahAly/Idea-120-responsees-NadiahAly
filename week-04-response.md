One type of image that would be read differently if seen in another medium is Ads, especially ones that are sponsored by celebrities.
What occurs is that a celebrity is sponsored by a brand to post an image of themselves with a specific product on social media. The products are in a celebrities post and they have a extenuated vibrance and detail. In turn catching the eye of the viewer.
The Linguistic Message is usually the caption on the post that has the hashtag of the brand or product as pictured in the post. It directs the viewer to focus on the meaning and intent of the post.
The symbolic message Is typically one depending on the product. If it is a sports drink, usually the gym, strength, and fit are what is emphasized from looking at the image. If the product is clothes usually figure and fit as well as quality of the specific item is symbolized.
The literal message is just the picture as it is, a celebrity posting their everyday life.
