<h> Accessibility in gaming and coding can help improve video games as well as other forms of media through perspective change, creativity increase, and the change of narrative. </h>

<p>Anna Anthropy analyzes the past, present, and what the future could became through the accessibility of video gaming and coding. What is discussed is that one of the main problems with current, mainstream video games is that they are created for a specific group of people. The main audience is young adults who are male. That is typically why we see shooting and car games as a repetitive factor in the video games we all play. This is a problem as other groups and experiences are not brought to light. By having more accessible gaming and coding other perspectives and experiences can be brought to life. For example, Anna herself is a queer woman and was able to create a videogame highlighting that part of her identity. Like what Anna created others with more accessibility can create a space where their space and experiences are highlighted. In turn this can shift that audience from only young adult males to an inclusive environment where all are represented, and a wide range of experiences and perspectives are shown. </p>

 
 

<p>Anna Anthropy also analyzes the current limitations of videogames and coding not just in the audience aspect but also in the creators. Videogames are typically created by a “small, insular group of people” Videogames are related to the experience and knowledge of one and can include origins as well. As computers started being accessible to everyone the creation of video games became gatekeeped due to their profitable benefits. The internet made and can continue to assist in revealing those secrets. With more accessibility, those experiences of individuals can open to new ideas and forms in video games. With no limits in gaming, individuals can make room for creativity and use what they know to expand the content of video games into a limitless reality. Smaller creators could be more experimental and create a bizarre game that was never thought of before. Feeding into the new perspective idea as stated above, innovative ideas can be created and highlighted. </p>

 

<p>As more individuals can gain access to video games and coding it changes and expands the narrative of what video games are. As mentioned, video games were created for one audience type and many games are centered and marketed toward that group. By expanding the accessibility of creating videogames, we can take note of the values of the people who make the videogames. This in turn can change the narrative of what video games are. Where we once saw them as just a form of leisure and entertainment, the narrative can change and expand into it, being a form of art. Taking YouTube to exemplify this factor, when YouTube was first created it was mostly extremely limited in what it could do. Now we have seen the possibilities which YouTube has to offer. Anything you desire you can watch on YouTube, tutorials, vlogs, pranks, news channels, music to name a few. Videogames can have the same effect where you are able to play anything you want and create anything you want. Videogames can change from that original narrative to being looked at as a variety of opportunities and involved aspects of authoring a story or drawing a picture. </p> 

 

<p>Other media can benefit from using 'game' creation tools. With easy access to videogame materials individuals will create videogames with the tools they have at hand. Its design will target demographics that speak to the individual, their identity, and experiences. For example gamer maker and Unity are tools that allow easy access to the game creation aspect. By giving direct access to people their creativity will not be limited and new forms and ideas will arise. Looking into similar experiences with other forms of media, accessibility, and the tools in which are used to create games can benefit these media types as well. Allowing people to create freely with any aspect of society we can witness new ways to live and succeed as a group rather than as an individual.</p>
