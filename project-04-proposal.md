In my portfolio, the content will be included in projects 1, project 2, and project 3 as well as a project done in my sculpture class. For each project, I think I would include an image of the project itself that draws the interest of individuals that first see it and then include a caption as people press on the image. I want to format mine in a similar aspect as Stefan Sagmeister where when entering the website all you see are photos of the project and when you press on those images it takes you to a full view of the project itself as well as an artist statement and explanation of the piece.
