Everything may truely not be as it seems 
Fear the technology as it takes over your livelihood, your world 
Think about it, who are you really talking to through the screen
Question your surrounding and what you precieve, interact and immerse yourself in the presence 
But in the end question and do not get angry when you realize you have been fooled in the name of technology
