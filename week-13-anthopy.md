THREE QUESTIONS 
Would a game like super smash bros be different without the sound effects and music playing? How would silence affect the aspect of a game?

<p>The relationship between art and politics is intertwined. Many forms of art such as graffiti, murals, and music forms have been used to create a statement in moments of political uprisings. In turn, this could allow the public to reinterpret differnt social structures in society. This form of art activism has arisen in many different forms. For example, Environmental artists use a material that individuals usually refer to as “trash” and create something beautiful out of it. These activists seek ways in which to warn people about certain situations but also provide solutions. With this in mind, the question that I thought of was, To what extent can the gaming world change political views or policies in the near future? With art activists on the rise with their creativity and allowing the public to view a different side of a political moment, could games do the same?</p>

<p>Anna Anthropy discusses a few instances in which games were not used as a form of entertainment but rather to create a statement from which individuals are able to understand and learn. A game that she mentions was, created in an attempt to educate those that play it about the dynamics at work in experiencing horrible real-life situations. If more games were created to address forms such as these, they might gain attention from the public and policymakers. Taking important subjects and tying them into what many see as a form of entertainment or a source of fun, one can inherently create a difference in one's life and opinion. To further add, as the gaming industry and its tools have a grasp on many young individuals, it could allow an open opportunity to create an accepting society for all through the games played.</p>

<p>Similar to environmental activists, and political activists the gaming industry has a huge influence on those that play them. By having more mainstream gamer activists, a community could be created organizing around a certain goal. There is a matter of fact of differentiating opinions in which different individuals have contrasting values and goals. There is also the potentiality of propaganda essentially embedding itself into the games. With these in mind, it creates uncertainty whether or not the games we play or could play can change societal functions and laws. </p>
