I agree with the problems that Bridle lays out. There has been a very present domino effect where when children watch one video on Youtube or search one thing on the net, then millions of other shows pop up as recommendations. There has been a spurge of violence and uncomforted in videos in the last few years and it is impossible to know whos coming up with the ideas and also roleplaying them. I think that I agree with the aspect that Bridle points out that the has been a lot of unverified and harmful content and I also agree with their solutions. I think responsibility and accountability are one of the first steps. But these videos have hurt millions at this point and we need better mechanisms to stop them. 


I think I somewhat agree with what Bridle states in what the internet should be. There should be no violence or psychological trauma attached to videos that children are watching at a young age that will increase violent and harmful tendencies in the future. I think that the internet should be a safe place, for connections, content, and communication. I also think though we have always been warned and there really is no way to stop the content from occurring. Where it should be a safe place, we all know that there are always loopholes that seem to break through. I think that the internet is a big aspect and we cannot just control it.
