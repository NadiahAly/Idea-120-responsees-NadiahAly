In Chicago, the Chicago Police Department uses an audio surveillance system that aims to catch the sound and location of a gunshot. This system is known as the ShotSpotter. This system is funded by Chicago, which spends about $10 million per year to ensure that this system is and will continue to run. This system is not located all over Chicago but remains primarily in communities that have a large population of Black and LatinX personas. The city of Chicago insists that this program has reduced gun violence and increased arrests for gun-related crimes.  The reality is, there is no evidence provided that this information as it is only sends the police after shots are fired, and it is a waste of city resources. This not only wastes resources by deploying CPD into black and brown communities for a needless reason creates a dangerous space for their communities. Shotspotter instead of relying on communities trains police to follow technology.  
This is similar to what Cathy O’Neil proposes in her Weapons of Mass Destruction idea. Essentially WMDs are algorithms that plan to create a positive outcome but instead what is created is something harmful leading to a reinforced classification system and inequality. WMDs affect large groups of populations because of a mistake created by an algorithm. This is similar to the Shotspotter situation. Shotspotter can essentially be labeled as a WMD because where the idea of reducing gun violence is what is wanted what actually occurs is a surveillance system of black and brown communities. If CPD arrives armed at a scene after a Shotspotter detection, they are going to be more alert and treat everyone as a threat, especially with the potential situation that might unfold. This puts communities with the Shotspotter system in danger and at risk especially since most times the detections are false and not gun-related at all. 

Thinking about the Shotspotter system, O’Neil uses a similar example known as the stop and frisk. What is different from stop and frisk and Shotspotter is that shotspotter is an actual detection algorithm that then relies on human judgment whereas stop and frisk are solely on judgment. Both though, have a nasty feedback loop where individuals are harassed and punished for being “high risk” individuals and labeled as criminals before a situation is assessed. Then comparing to majority White communties who do not even have a program such as Shotspotter or a heavily policed area and are not as internally surveilled as black and brown communities.
