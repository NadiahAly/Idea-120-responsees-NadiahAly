# CGI/AI NON-LINEAR PROJECT
The idea that I have in mind for my non-linear narrative is to create a story based on a CGI or AI robot that does not understand that they are a machine and functions as a human. I think that what this story would not give away is that it is a robot until possibly the end depending on the choices that the reader picks. I want to make it seem like it is a human being but there is always something off with the story. The questions would create decisions for the reader to pick what the character would do and depend on what is picked it will either continue to be subtly inference that the character is a robot or the signs will start coming out drastically. I am planning on making it one character based so that the story is not over complicated. I will attempt to incorporate both story and poem to get a slight variation of mediums into the project. This is the idea I have so far and I plan on over the weekend to play around with twine and see the possibilities of what I am able to create with the time that I have.
