Murray was also accurate with VR as it has become more common in our society to participate in the explorable fictional space. I also believe that she was successful in the statement of the fact that due to this advancement we might get lost in reality and fantasy. In a way we have. An example would be that there have already been lots of situations where CGI has become realistic in the eyes of humans. So I do believe that the prediction was pretty successful.
