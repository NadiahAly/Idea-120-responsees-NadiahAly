  One of the main points that both O’Neil and Chalabi discuss which affects not only me but others daily is deception in media. This could take the form of statistics or ads, but deception takes the form of individuals believing in what is being presented or offered when there is always an ulterior motive. Looking at my personal experience I tend to fall for this all the time, especially when it comes to ads. It always seems to shock me when I speak about or look up a particular object or resource and then only ads related to that subject begin to overflow my screen. When using the media I fall into the hands of vulnerability and that is what these ads feed off of. A moment in time I remember researching career options because I began doubting what path I want to go down. Using technology and research to my advantage it almost seemed like I was getting more lost because instead of the answers to my questions being the first ones to pop up in the search bar it always was ads to certain schools. Almost as if it knew that I was in a state of vulnerability and in need of a motivator.  The ads were answered as it was presented to me in form of a school. I feel like I don't remember taking a survey but I know that weeks later I received mail from the school ad that I clicked on. Looking at O’Neil’s essay it seemed like I got trapped in the For-Profit school scam. Although I never applied to the school, I was still subjected to the persuasiveness of their ads. 
	
  My feelings become mixed and unsure when I look into the question of if the internet would be more useful and egalitarian without these methods or will it be more useful. I think it sways both ways depending on what the advertiser or designer's ultimate goal is. For this, I will be using the example of ads. I think ads are useful in the sense that they direct individuals to what they are searching for. Even if I am not going to shop or pay attention to a specific website that an ad has directed me towards, by it just being there I can further research what product or idea I am looking for. For example, if I am looking for a coffee machine per se, and I receive an ad about one. I might click on the ad look at what the product possesses but might go to a different website to purchase. So the ad assisted in directing me towards the product that I do want. On the other hand, think about O’Neil’s example of the College Board, where it creates this narrative of assisting all high school students, but its motive is to attack low-income students by creating a logical system of directing them towards for-profit schools, the internet in this aspect seems unuseful. So it is just a matter of what perspective is presented. I think it can be used for good but it is in human nature to push our limits and see what we can achieve good or bad.
